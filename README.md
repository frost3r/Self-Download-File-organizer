# Self-Download-File-organizer
This is a file organizer, which based on pre-given keywords organizes downloads into folders.

I did not try to access the OS and the download folder in my computer to reduce complexity and restrictions from inbuilt security.

However the idea still works and can later be changed to a working model.

Thank you..
